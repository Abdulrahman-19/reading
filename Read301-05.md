# Thinking in React

React is the way to build a big, fast web application using JavaScript.
"One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them".

1. How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?

- draw boxes around every component in the mock and name them.
- Use technique called **single responsibility principle**.
- Separate your UI into component
- identified the components in our mock

2. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
that the component should do only one thing.

3. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
 It means that you want to build components that re use other components and pass data using props.

4. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State.
5. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

- Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
- Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
- Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

6. How can you identify where state needs to live?

In the component that changes its value.
The common Owner of the state.
The Parant Commponent if the state is in a Chiled component.
