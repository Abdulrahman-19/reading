# Controlled Components

Controlled components is the way of making the react have the full control of the Html components.So the Html components should be renderd from React.

- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
No, the react will handel the changings in the render(). this what makes the react the single sorce of information.

- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
By adding an Event argument in the constructor function and pass the value to the render function using setState().

## Ternary Operator

"The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement."

- Why would we use a ternary operator?
To shorten your If statment in to one line of code.

- x===y ? true : false
