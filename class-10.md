# Debugging

Mistakes and bad input are facts of life. Bugs in programs need to be found and fixed. They can become easier to notice by having automated test suites and adding assertions to your programs.

Problems caused by factors outside the programâ€™s control should usually be handled gracefully. Sometimes, when the problem can be handled locally, special return values are a sane way to track them. Otherwise, exceptions are preferable.

Throwing an exception causes the call stack to be unwound until the next enclosing try/catch block or until the bottom of the stack. The exception value will be given to the catch block that catches it, which should verify that it is actually the expected kind of exception and then do something with it. To deal with the unpredictable control flow caused by exceptions, finally blocks can be used to ensure a piece of code is always run when a block finishes.
