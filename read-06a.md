# How Computers Work

Everywhere you look, computers are changing the world.Whether they're on our desktops, in our homes, our pockets, or just about anywhere else.
But while most of us use this revolutionary technology daily,we don't often ask: "How do computers work?"In this series, you're going to learn how computers really work,
starting with what makes a computer a computer.
Finally, you'll take a look at what code actually is and how software controls hardware.the first step is learning how computers work.
## What Makes a Computer, a Computer?
Computers are everywhere!They're in people's pockets, they're in people's cars, people have them on their wrists.They might be in your backpack right now.
**But what makes a computer a computer?**
the computers would need to take input,store _information process_ it and then output the results.Now this might sound simple,but these four things are common to all computers.That's what makes a **computer a computer**.
## Binary & Data

- Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer.

- The signal could either be _on_ or _off_(0,1).With one wire, we can represent a yes or no,true or false,a one or zero,or anything else with only two options.

- we need to learn about something called the **binary number system**.

- the information will be stored in computer in zeros and ones per wire
for example 8-wires can store numbers between **0 and 255**, 32-wires you can store from 0 to 4-billion,And we call it bits. 

- So if you want to understand how computers work on the inside,it all comes down these simple ones and zeros and the **electrical signals** in the circuits behind them.

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output

Let's talk about input first.Computers can take many different types of input, like the keyboard of a computer, the touchpad of a phone,a camera, a microphone, or a GPS.But even the sensors on a car, a thermostat, or a drone are also different input devices. Now, let's look at a simple example of how input travels through a computer and becomes output.
When you press a key on your keyboard - let's say the letter "B". The keyboard converts the letter to a number.That number is sent as binary, ones and zeros, into the computer.

The _screen_ is an **output device**, which converts the binary signals into the tiny lights and colors that make up what you see.No matter what it is you want to do with the computer, every single action is about:inputting information from the physical world,storing and processing that information,and getting some output back into the physical world.
