# Forms and JS Events

## Forms

Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information.
HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to your site.
Whether you are adding a simple search box to your website or you need to create more complicated insurance applications, HTML forms give you a set of elements to collect data from your users.

## Lists, Tables & Forms

There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types of HTML elements, such as lists, tables, and forms.
CSS Proparites For Lists:

- Bullet Point Styles(list-style-type)
- Images for Bullets(list-style-image)
- Positioning the Marker(list-style-position)
- List Shorthand(list-style)

CSS Proparites For Tables:

- Border on Empty Cells(empty-cells)
- Gaps Between Cells(border-spacing,border-collapse)

## Events

When you browse the web, your browser registers different types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this just happened." Your script can then respond to these events.

Scripts often respond to these events by updating the content of the web page (via the Document Object Model) which makes the page feel more interactive. In this chapter, you will learn how:

- INTERACTIONS CREATE EVENTS.
- EVENTS TRIGGER CODE.
- CODE RESPONDS TO USERS.
