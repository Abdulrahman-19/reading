# What Google Learned About Teams

**How to Build a Perfect Team:**

- Focus on roles. A thorough selection process for picking your team members has greater long-term benefits, even if this means you spend more time recruiting than you'd like to.
- Value each role.
- Communicate.
- Set goals.
- Celebrate successes and failures.
- Know each other.

War rooms were first introduced during war times, unsurprisingly, which is where the name originates from. War rooms were used by generals and military leaders to discuss tactics and strategies to move the war forward. This is exactly how it is still used today, but in project management, as opposed to war.
