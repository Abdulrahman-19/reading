# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

- What is functional programming?
    Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming>
- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
    1. It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as **deterministic**)
    2. It does not cause any observable side effects.
- What are the benefits of a pure function?
    The use of functions in such situations avoids duplication of effort and code in programs. This reduces the size of the source program as well as the executable program. It also reduces the time required to write, test, debug and maintain such programs, thus reducing program development and maintenance cost. <https://ecomputernotes.com>
- What is immutability?
    Immutability is the idea that data or objects should not be modified after they are created. <https://www.ctl.io>
- What is Referential transparency?
    pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency. <https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa>.

## Modules and require()

- What is a module?
    The Module is a JS file that is used in another js File.
- What does the word ‘require’ do?
    it exports the data from a file.
- How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
    by require the module file path.
- What do we have to do to make a module available?
    be exporting what we need from the module.
