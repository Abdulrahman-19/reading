# REST

- Who is Roy Fielding?
    Some guy. He's smart.
- Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
    "Look, we've been talking about this with a lot of abstraction. How about we take a real example. Imagine you are a teacher - at school you probably have a big computer system, or three or four computer systems more likely, that would let you manage students: what classes they're in, what grades they're getting, emergency contacts, information about the books you teach out of, etc. If the systems are web-based, then there's probably a URL for each of the nouns involved here: student, teacher, class, book, room, etc. Right now, getting the URL through the browser gives you a web page. If there were a machine readable representation for each URL, then it would be trivial to latch new tools onto the system because all of that information would be consumable in a standard way. It would also make it quite a bit easier for each of the systems to talk to each other. Or, you could build a state- or country-wide system that was able to talk to each of the individual school systems to collect testing scores. The possibilities are endless."
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
    "he talks a lot about what those things point to in that research I was talking about. The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”"
- What does a GET do?
     "The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. But the important thing here is that very different kinds of nouns can be treated the same. Whether the noun is an image, text, video, an mp3, a slideshow, whatever. I can GET all of those things the same way given a URL."
- What does a POST do?
    A power-on self-test (POST) is a process performed by firmware or software routines immediately after a computer or other digital electronic device is powered on. ... In addition to running tests, the POST process may also set the initial state of the device from firmware.(Power-on self-test - Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org>)
- What does PUT do?
    Used to create a resource, or overwrite it. While you specify the resources new URL. The PUT method requests that the state of the target resource be created or replaced with the state defined by the representation enclosed in the request message payload.(<https://stackoverflow.com>)
- What does PATCH do?
The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource. PATCH is somewhat analogous to the "update" concept found in CRUD (in general, HTTP is different than CRUD, and the two should not be confused). A PATCH request is considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource.(<https://developer.mozilla.org>)
