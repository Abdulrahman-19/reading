# Chart.js, Canvas

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.

**Chart.js** is a free open-source JavaScript library for data visualization, which supports 8 chart types: bar, line, area, pie (doughnut), bubble, radar, polar, and scatter. Created by London-based web developer Nick Downie in 2013, now it is maintained by the community and is the second most popular JS charting library on GitHub by the number of stars after D3.js, considered significantly easier to use though less customizable than the latter. Chart.js renders in HTML5 canvas and is widely covered as one of the best data visualization libraries. It is available under the MIT license.

- What is HTML Canvas?
The HTML **canvas** element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

The **canvas** element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.

Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
