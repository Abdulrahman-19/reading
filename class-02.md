# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## HTML

- Headings and paragraphs
- Bold, italic, emphasis
- Structural and semantic markup

There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages â€” they are known as semantic markup.

1. strong
2. em
3. blockquote

## CSS

**CSS** allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

## JAVASCRIPT

- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file.**JavaScript** files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extension.
- The HTML **script** element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the **link** element can be used to load a CSS file).
- If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
