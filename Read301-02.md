# State and Props

## Lifecycle of Components

React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

- constructor()
- getDerivedStateFromProps()
- render()
- componentDidMount()
The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.

## Handling Events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

- React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

## Conditional Rendering

In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

- React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript
- Accessible by default
