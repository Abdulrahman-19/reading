# Authentication

- What is OAuth?
    OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization. <https://www.csoonline.com/>

- Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.
    using G-mail to sighn in to a web site.

- How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?

1. The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.
2. The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
3. The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.
4. The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).
5. If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is askedto    approve the authorization transaction to the second website.
6. The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.
7. The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).
8. The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
9. The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
10. The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.
11. The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.
12. OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user. In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly. What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption. It succeeded with adoption rates where previous attempts failed (for various reasons).

- What is OpenID?
"OpenID is for humans logging into machines, OAuth is for machines logging into machines on behalf of humans."

## Authorization and Authentication flows

- What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
    Authentication and authorization might sound similar, but they are distinct security processes in the world of identity and access management (IAM). Authentication confirms that users are who they say they are. Authorization gives those users permission to access a resource.

- What is Authorization Code Flow?
    Authorization code flow is used to obtain an access token to authorize API requests.<https://dev.mendeley.com>
- What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?
    The Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE, pronounced pixie) extension describes a technique for public clients to mitigate the threat of having the authorization code intercepted.<https://www.oauth.com>
- What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?
    Implicit Flow with Form Post flow uses OIDC to implement web sign-in that is very similar to the way SAML and WS-Federation operates. The web app requests and obtains tokens through the front channel, without the need for secrets or extra backend calls. With this method, you don’t need to obtain, maintain, use, and protect a secret in your application.<https://www.oauth.com>
- What is Client Credentials Flow?
    In the client credentials flow, permissions are granted directly to the application itself by an administrator. When the app presents a token to a resource, the resource enforces that the app itself has authorization to perform an action since there is no user involved in the authentication.

- What is Device Authorization Flow?
    With input-constrained devices that connect to the internet, rather than authenticate the user directly, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device. This avoids a poor user experience for devices that do not have an easy way to enter text.<https://auth0.com>
- What is Resource Owner Password Flow?
    The Resource Owner Password Credentials flow allows exchanging the username and password of a user for an access token and, optionally, a refresh token. ... The primary difference is that the user's password is accessible to the application. This requires strong trust of the application by the user.<https://www.oreilly.com>
