# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

## Tables

- How to create tables
- What information suits tables
- How to represent complex data in tables

There are several types of information that need to be displayed in a grid or table. For example: sports results, stock reports, train timetables.

When representing information in a table, you need to think in terms of a grid made up of rows and columns (a bit like a spreadsheet). In this chapter you will learn how to:
● Use the four key elements for creating tables
● Represent complex data using tables
● Add captions to tables

## Functions, Methods, and Objects

- CREATING OBJECTS USING CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX

On the right, an empty object called hote 1 is created using the constructor function.
Once it has been created, three properties and a method are then assigned to the object. (If the object already had any of these properties, this would overwrite the values in those properties.)
To access a property of this object, you can use dot notation,just as you can with any object.

- CREATE & ACCESS OBJECTS CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION
- ARRAYS ARE OPJECTS

Arrays are special type of objects.
