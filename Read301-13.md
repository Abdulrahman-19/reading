# CRUD

- In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
100’s = the header of the request is received
200’s = the clint request was accepted
300’s = for redirection
400’s = clint error codes
500’s = server error codes
- What is a status code 202?
    Accepted - Often used for asynchronous processing. This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future.<https://www.moesif.com/>
- What is a status code 308?
     Permanent Redirect - This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore.<https://www.moesif.com/>
- What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?
    we use PATCH to return a certant amount of data and see what is wrong with it.
- What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
     404 code indicates that the requested resource is not currently available, but it could be available in future requests. Conversely, a 410 code is an explicit indication that the requested resource used to exist, but it has since been permanently removed and will not be available in the future.

- What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?
    The HTTP 403 Forbidden client error status response code indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. This status is similar to 401 , but in this case, re-authenticating will make no difference. <https://developer.mozilla.org>
