# SUMMARY

Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## HTML

CONTENT LAYER .html files This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.

Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the most important thing about your site: its content.

## CSS

PRESENTATION LAYER .css files The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented(backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).
Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself.

## JAVASCRIPT

BEHAVIOR LAYER .js files This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.
The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site.
