# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Links

- Creating links between pages
- Linking to other sites
- Email links

Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

- Links are created using the (a) element.
- The (a) element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

## Layout

- Controlling the position of elements
- Creating site layouts
- Designing for different sized screens

**Building Blocks**CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

**Screen Sizes** Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects

- **Functions**
**JavaScript function** is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ()Function names can contain letters, digits,underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables)The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, ...).

- Methods
**JavaScript methods** are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties.

- Opjects
An **object** is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

**How does pair programming work?**

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.

**Why pair program?**

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
