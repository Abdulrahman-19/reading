# Mongo and Mongoose

| SQL | NOSQL |
| --- | --- |
| Relational Databases  | non-relational or distributed database |
| structured query language | dynamic schemas for unstructured data |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| table based | document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores |
| better for multi-row transactions | better for unstructured data |

- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    | DATA | EXAMPLE |
    | --- | --- |
    | If the data is numeric  | SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT, or DECIMAL |
    | If the data is character |  CHAR or VARCHAR data types. |
    | If the data is date and time | DATE, TIME, and TIMESTAMP data types |
    | If the data is multimedia | GRAPHIC, VARGRAPHIC, BLOB, CLOB, or DBCLOB data types |

- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
    Graph database.
- Which type of database is best for scalability?
    NOSQL databases.

- What does SQL stand for?
    Structured Query Language
- What is a realational database?
    A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. ... In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key.<https://www.oracle.com>

- What is a ‘schema’?
    A database schema represents the logical configuration of all or part of a relational database.<https://www.lucidchart.com>
- What is a NoSQL database?
    non-relational database.
- how does it work?
    NoSQL is particularly useful for storing unstructured data, which is growing far more rapidly than structured data and does not fit the relational schemas of RDBMS. Common types of unstructured data include: user and session data; chat, messaging, and log data; time series data such as IoT and device data; and large objects such as video and images.<https://riak.com>
- What is inside of a Mongo database?
    A document is a representation of a single entity of data in the MongoDB database. A collection consists of one or more related objects. A major difference exists between MongoDB and SQL, in that documents are different from rows. Row data is flat, with one column for each value in the row.

- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB is more fast and scalable in comparison to the SQL server.
Why :
MongoDB doesn't support JOIN and Global transactions but the SQL server supports it. MongoDB supports a big amount of data but the MS SQL server doesn't. MongoDB support Agile practices but MS SQL server doesn't support it.<https://www.educba.com>
- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    If you store a data in noSQL data base and try to read it imeaditly it will not be found, Because the data will take some time to read from the merord servers.
