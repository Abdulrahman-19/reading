## Images

- Controlling size of images in CSS
- Aligning images in CSS
- Adding background images

You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.
Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.

- You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.
- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.
- You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.
- Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.
- You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
- To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.
